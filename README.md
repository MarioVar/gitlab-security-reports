# gitlab-security-reports JSON to HTML Report Generator

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to convert JSON artifacts generated by static application security testing (SAST) and container scanning stages into clean, modern, and readable HTML reports.

## 🔍 Overview

During CI/CD pipelines, SAST and container scanning tools often produce large JSON output files that are hard to read and analyze quickly. This repository provides simple tools to transform those JSON reports into interactive HTML tables with enhanced readability.

## 📂 Scripts

- `sast_json_to_html.py`: Converts a SAST tool JSON output into an HTML report.
- `container_scan_json_to_html.py`: Converts a container scanning JSON output into an HTML report.

Both scripts output a modern HTML file styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and include sorting and filtering features.

## 📦 Example Use

```bash
python sast_json_to_html.py sast_report.json sast_report.html
python container_scan_json_to_html.py container_report.json 
```

## 📑 Output Format

Each HTML report contains a table with the following columns:

## 💡 Why Use This

## 🛠️ Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
